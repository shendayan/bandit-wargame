Bandit Level 4 → Level 5
Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. 
Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

Commands you may need to solve this level

ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

At first we have to log in with "ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" and the hash from the previous level as the password.

That sounds nice "if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command". Let's not mess something up :)
Lets have a look into the directories.

bandit4@bandit:~$ ls
inhere
bandit4@bandit:~$ cd inhere/
bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ ls
-file00  -file01  -file02  -file03  -file04  -file05  -file06  -file07  -file08  -file09

To read all this files sucks. Maybe we can find out the password without messing around with so many files.
If I had to set up a CTF like this, I probably would place the password in one of the last files.
So lets "cat" the last three, to see if I think like the creators.

bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ cat /home/bandit4/inhere/-file09

bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ cat /home/bandit4/inhere/-file08

bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ cat /home/bandit4/inhere/-file07

Maybe I do not think so much different from the creators.
Let's get to the next level.
