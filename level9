Bandit Level 8 â†’ Level 9
Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once
Commands you may need to solve this level

grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd


At first we have to log in with "ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" and the hash from the previous level as the password.

bandit8@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt

I "cat" this file, just to see what Im dealing with.
Man thats a lot of stuff. How can I find out the one unique line?

bandit8@bandit:~$ sort data.txt | uniq -u

That was as easy as the last level!
The key is to look up the commands that you dont know!
