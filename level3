Bandit Level 2 â†’ Level 3
Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory
Commands you may need to solve this level

ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

We have to log in first with "ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" and the hash from the last level as the password.
If you "ls" the contents of your current working directory, you should see a file named "spaces in this filename".
There are more then one possibilities to read the content of this file.
You can put the filename in quotes or write "cat s" and hit tab for autocompleting.

You should have an output like this (depending on what method you used).

bandit2@bandit:~$ cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename 
UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5XXX
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat "spaces in this filename" 
UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5XXX

Let's move on :)
