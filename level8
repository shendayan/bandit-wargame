Bandit Level 7 â†’ Level 8
Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth

Commands you may need to solve this level

grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

At first we have to log in with "ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" and the hash from the previous level as the password.

I used grep in the last level, so I know that it puts out the whole line.
Thats why I used this command:

bandit7@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | grep millionth
millionth	cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9XXX

That was quite easy!
