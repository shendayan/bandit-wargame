Bandit Level 5 â†’ Level 6
Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory 
and has all of the following properties:

    human-readable
    1033 bytes in size
    not executable

Commands you may need to solve this level

ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

At first we have to log in with "ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" and the hash from the previous level as the password.
Let's have a look around:

bandit5@bandit:~$ ls
inhere
bandit5@bandit:~$ cd inhere/
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ ls -l
total 80

Damn! Every directory has nine files and I really don't want to "cat" them all....
Let's "find" the right file.

If you are not familiar with the "find" command, you should look it up with "find --help".

bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ find -size 1033c
./maybehere07/.file2
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ./maybehere07/.file2

Here we go :)
