Bandit Level 1 â†’ Level 2
Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory

Commands you may need to solve this level

ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

Now you can log in that new user with " ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" 
and the hash from the previous level as the password.

If you "ls" now, you can see a file with a dash as filename.
You can't "cat" a file thats named "-" because cat awaits an argument after a dash.
E.g. "cat -n" for numbering all the lines.
So you have to use a little trick an type "cat /home/bandit1/-" and it should output something like that:

bandit1@bandit:~$ cat /home/bandit1/-
