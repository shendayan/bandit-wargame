Bandit Level 3 â†’ Level 4
Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.

Commands you may need to solve this level

ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

At first we have to log in with "ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" and the hash from the previous level as the password.
If you type "ls", you can see a directory named "inhere". Let's cd in that dir.
"cd inhere"
If you "ls" this directory, you will notice that you get no output.
Thats because the simple "ls" command doesen't show hidden files and directories.
If you "ls -la" you should get an output like this:

bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ ls -la
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 2 root    root    4096 Sep 23 21:10 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root    root    4096 Sep 23 21:10 ..
-rw-r----- 1 bandit4 bandit3   33 Sep 23 21:10 .hidden

To read the contents of this hidden file, you can simply type: "cat .hidden".

bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ cat .hidden 
pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFXXX

And there you go.
