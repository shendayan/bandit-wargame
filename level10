Bandit Level 9 → Level 10
Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, 
beginning with several ‘=’ characters.

Commands you may need to solve this level

grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

At first we have to log in with "ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" and the hash from the previous level as the password.

To complete this task we have to find out the human-readable "strings" of this file and 
extract the strings with several = characters at the beginning.
If a command called "strings" is given in the suggested commands section, we should use this :)
It prints out a huge list of nonsense. Lets "grep" the = characters. I think three are some kind of "several".

bandit9@bandit:~$ strings data.txt | grep ===

========== password
========== is
========== truKLdjsbJ5g7yyJ2X2R0o3a5HQJFXXX

Thats a nice output and we made it to the next level! :)
