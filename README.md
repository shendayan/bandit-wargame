In this file I will write down my progress in the wargame Bandit from http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/

All progress is done by me without any other writeup help.
It is possible that I got help from some of the kind Users of the IRC channel below.

Encrypted IRC:
	Host: ircs.overthewire.org
	Port: 6697 (with SSL)

Non-encrypted IRC:
	Host: irc.overthewire.org
	Port: 6667

Channel: #wargames (for talk related to the games) or #social (for general talk)

Because I just want to help you and not solve your puzzles, I dont write down the complete hashes.
So to get ahead, you have to type it yourself.
