Bandit Level 6 â†’ Level 7
Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:

    owned by user bandit7
    owned by group bandit6
    33 bytes in size

Commands you may need to solve this level

ls, cd, cat, file, du, find, grep



At first we have to log in with "ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" and the hash from the previous level as the password.

For this task we need to take a closer look at the (referring to the manpage) "List FILEs"-tool.

/*BEGINNER TIPP:
*If you dont know: Most of the tools in a Linux distribution got a manual. You can open it with "man NAME".
*So lets read a little of the "man ls".
*
*SYNOPSIS
*       ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
*What means you have to write "ls -l /home/".
*Which options could be useful now?
*
*-l     use a long listing format
*For having a look at the user and group of a file.
*-R, --recursive
*             list subdirectories recursively
*For looking into all directories in /
*-s, --size
*             print the allocated size of each file, in blocks
*For using the size of the files as info for "grep".
*BEGINNER TIPP END
*/

Lets have a look what "ls -lRs /" shows to us.
Man, what a tree :D Thats way to much information... Lets reduce it a bit using the "grep" command.

/*BEGINNER TIPP:
*Lets have a closer look at the "grep" command.
*The "grep" command lets you pick some special entries of a programs output.
*For the basic use, you have to write "grep something" after the pipe.
*E.g. "ls /home/ | grep mydata"
*Grep has a very detailed manpage "man grep".
*BEGINNER TIPP

Maybe grepping the size and the owner could lead to a useful output.
So I tried the following:

bandit6@bandit:~$ ls -lRsa / | grep bandit7

What lead to many "Permission denied" Errors and a huge output.
But if we look closer at the list, we can see, that there are very few files.
There are:

4 -r--------  1 bandit7  bandit7    33 Sep 23 21:10 bandit7
4088 -rw-r-----  1 bandit8 bandit7 4184396 Sep 23 21:10 data.txt
4 -rw-r----- 1 bandit7 bandit6      33 Sep 23 21:10 bandit7.password

The last entry looks promising, so lets "cat" it.
Damn, we dont know the path to the file.

To find out the path I used:

bandit6@bandit:~$ find / -name "bandit7.password" | grep password

Which lead to a massive "Permisson denied" swarm and one file....

/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

So lets "cat" it.


bandit6@bandit:~$ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

Here we go.
